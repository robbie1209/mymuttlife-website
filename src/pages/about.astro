      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        My Mutt Life was born out of frustration. Not with dogs — we could never be frustrated with dogs — but with the ocean of misleading, sponsored, and frankly unhelpful "advice" that floods the internet whenever you search for something as simple as "what should I feed my Labrador."
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted something different: a site that gives UK dog owners <strong>honest, practical, no-nonsense advice</strong>. The kind of thing you'd get from a trusted friend who happens to know a lot about dogs.
      </p>

      <h2>Meet Poppy</h2>
      <p>
        Every good dog story starts with a dog, and ours starts with <strong>Poppy</strong> — a black Labrador with an opinion about everything and an appetite to match. Poppy is the reason we started researching dog food so obsessively, why we can tell you the difference between glucosamine and chondroitin at a dinner party, and why we believe every dog deserves an owner who takes the time to get things right.
      </p>
      <p>
        She's our chief product tester, our motivational paw-ker, and the face (well, muzzle) behind everything we do.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We research, test, and write comprehensive guides on everything related to dog care in the UK:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dog Food Reviews</strong> — breed-specific nutrition guides with honest assessments of UK-available brands</li>
        <li><strong>Health & Supplements</strong> — evidence-based advice on joint care, senior health, and preventive wellness</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Comparisons</strong> — clear breakdowns of UK pet insurance so you can make an informed choice</li>
        <li><strong>Lifestyle & Gear</strong> — walking essentials, exercise guides, and seasonal tips for every dog owner</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <p>
        Every article on My Mutt Life is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Honest</strong> — we say what we think, even about popular products</li>
        <li><strong>Well-researched</strong> — we cite veterinary guidance and real-world experience</li>
        <li><strong>UK-focused</strong> — prices in pounds, products you can actually buy, advice that's relevant here</li>
        <li><strong>Updated regularly</strong> — our guides are living documents, not set-and-forget</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        Transparency matters to us. Some of our articles contain affiliate links — this means if you click through and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us keep the lights on and Poppy in dental chews.
      </p>
      <p>
        Importantly: <strong>affiliate relationships never influence our recommendations</strong>. If a product isn't good enough for our dogs, it's not good enough for yours. Full stop.
