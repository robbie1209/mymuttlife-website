      <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the links on My Mutt Life (mymuttlife.co.uk) are affiliate links. This means that if you click on one of these links and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission from the retailer — at <strong>no extra cost to you</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These commissions help us keep the website running, pay for research and testing, and continue creating free, high-quality content for UK dog owners.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
      <p>We participate in or may participate in the following affiliate programmes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazon Associates Programme:</strong> My Mutt Life is a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.co.uk.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Affiliate Programmes:</strong> We may also partner with other retailers and service providers relevant to dog care in the UK. These will always be clearly identifiable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Editorial Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        This is the most important part: <strong>affiliate relationships never influence our recommendations</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only recommend products and services that we genuinely believe are good for dogs and their owners. Our reviews and guides are based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Genuine research and, where possible, real-world testing</li>
        <li>Veterinary guidance and expert opinion</li>
        <li>Community feedback from UK dog owners</li>
        <li>Ingredient analysis and nutritional data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a product doesn't meet our standards, we won't recommend it — even if the affiliate commission is generous. Our reputation and your trust are worth more than any commission.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Identify Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p>
        Articles containing affiliate links will include a disclosure notice at the top and/or bottom of the content. We strive to be transparent about our commercial relationships at all times.
      </p>

      <h2>ASA Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We comply with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) guidelines regarding affiliate marketing and online advertising. All commercial content is clearly identified.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about our use of affiliate links, please contact us at <strong>hello@mymuttlife.co.uk</strong>. We're always happy to be transparent about how we fund the site.
