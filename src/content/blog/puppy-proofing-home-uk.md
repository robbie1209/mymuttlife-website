*Getting a new puppy is one of life's greatest joys — but your home is basically a playground of hazards from their perspective. Here's everything you need to do before those tiny paws hit the floor.*

## Why Puppy-Proofing Matters

Puppies explore the world with their mouths. If they can reach it, they'll chew it, swallow it, or at least give it a good lick. According to the RSPCA, **accidental poisoning and foreign body ingestion** are among the top emergency vet visits for puppies in the UK — and most are completely preventable.

The good news? A few hours of preparation can save you thousands in vet bills and a lot of heartache.

Think of it this way: if you'd baby-proof for a crawling toddler, you need to do the same for a puppy — except puppies are faster, more determined, and have sharper teeth.

## Room-by-Room Checklist

### 🛋️ Living Room

- **Electrical cables** — Tuck behind furniture or use cable protectors. A chewed cable can cause burns, electrocution, or fire
- **Remote controls & small items** — Batteries are extremely dangerous if swallowed (chemical burns). Keep remotes, pens, hair ties, and coins out of reach
- **Houseplants** — Move toxic plants to high shelves or remove them entirely (see plant list below)
- **Candles & diffusers** — Keep on high surfaces. Essential oil diffusers can be toxic to dogs, particularly tea tree, eucalyptus, and pennyroyal
- **Open fireplaces** — Fit a fireguard. Even when not lit, ash and soot are harmful if ingested
- **Low shelves** — Move books, ornaments, and anything chewable above puppy height
- **Rugs with tassels/fringe** — Can be chewed off and cause intestinal blockage
- **Curtain pull cords** — Strangulation risk. Tie up or replace with wand controls

### 🍳 Kitchen

- **Cleaning products** — Store in locked or high cupboards. Bleach, washing pods, dishwasher tablets, and antibacterial sprays are all dangerous
- **Bin** — Get a pedal bin with a secure lid, or keep it inside a cupboard. Kitchen waste is irresistible and often contains toxic foods
- **Toxic foods** — Keep well out of reach at ALL times:
  - 🍫 **Chocolate** (theobromine — dark/cooking chocolate is worst)
  - 🧅 **Onions, garlic, leeks, chives** (damages red blood cells)
  - 🍇 **Grapes & raisins** (kidney failure — even small amounts)
  - 🥜 **Macadamia nuts** (vomiting, tremors, hyperthermia)
  - 🫘 **Xylitol/artificial sweeteners** (found in sugar-free gum, peanut butter, baked goods — can be fatal)
  - 🥑 **Avocado** (persin toxin)
  - ☕ **Caffeine** (coffee grounds, tea bags)
  - 🍺 **Alcohol** (even small amounts are dangerous)
- **Dishwasher** — Keep closed when not in use. Detergent residue and sharp items inside
- **Oven & hob** — Use a stove guard if your puppy is likely to jump up (larger breeds especially)
- **Floor-level cupboards** — Fit child locks on any containing food, chemicals, or breakables

### 🛁 Bathroom

- **Medications** — Lock away ALL medicines, including paracetamol and ibuprofen (both highly toxic to dogs). Never leave tablets on counters
- **Toilet** — Keep the lid down. Cleaning chemicals in the bowl are toxic, and small puppies could fall in
- **Razors** — Store in a cabinet, not on the bath edge
- **Dental floss & cotton buds** — If swallowed, floss can wrap around intestines (a veterinary emergency)
- **Shampoo, soap, moisturisers** — Store in a closed cupboard. Puppies will chew bottles
- **Laundry basket** — Socks and underwear are among the most commonly swallowed foreign bodies in puppies

### 🛏️ Bedroom

- **Shoes** — Put them in a closed wardrobe or shoe rack. Aside from destruction, laces and small parts can be swallowed
- **Jewellery & hair accessories** — Store in drawers or on high surfaces
- **Phone charger cables** — Unplug when not in use or keep behind furniture
- **Pillows & bedding** — Watch for feather stuffing being pulled out and eaten (especially with destructive chewers)
- **Wardrobes** — Keep closed. Mothballs are toxic

### 🏠 Hallway & Stairs

- **Stair gate** — Essential for young puppies. A fall down stairs can cause fractures or worse
- **Shoes by the door** — Move to a closed cupboard or high shelf
- **Post & letters** — Puppies love shredding paper (and swallowing it). Use a letterbox cage or collect post immediately
- **Coats & bags** — Hang up. Bags may contain medications, food, gum (xylitol), or other hazards
- **Umbrella stands** — Can topple onto a curious puppy

### 🌿 Garden

- **Fencing** — Check for gaps, loose panels, and spaces under gates. Puppies can squeeze through surprisingly small gaps (a 10-week-old Labrador can fit through a 15cm gap)
- **Toxic plants** — Remove or fence off (see full list below)
- **Slug & snail pellets** — Metaldehyde-based pellets are extremely toxic. Switch to pet-safe iron phosphate alternatives (widely available at UK garden centres)
- **Rat/mouse poison** — Remove entirely or use enclosed bait stations well out of reach. Secondary poisoning (eating a poisoned rodent) is also a risk
- **Weedkiller & fertiliser** — Store in locked shed. Wait until fully dried/absorbed before letting puppy on treated areas
- **Compost bin** — Secure it. Decomposing matter can contain mycotoxins
- **Ponds & water features** — Fence off or cover. Even shallow water can be dangerous for small puppies. Algae blooms are toxic
- **Garden tools** — Store in shed. Rakes, shears, and forks left on the ground cause injuries
- **Stones & gravel** — Watch for puppies eating small stones (a surprisingly common cause of intestinal blockage)
- **Treated wood** — Decking or fences treated with preservatives shouldn't be chewed (most modern treatments are low-toxicity, but older ones may contain arsenic)

### 🚗 Garage & Utility Room

- **Antifreeze** — The single most dangerous household chemical for dogs. Ethylene glycol tastes sweet and is lethal in tiny amounts. Clean up any spills immediately, store securely, and consider switching to propylene glycol-based products
- **Motor oil & fuel** — Store in sealed containers on high shelves
- **Paint, varnish, white spirit** — Lock away
- **Tools & nails** — Keep in closed toolboxes
- **Washing machine & dryer** — Keep doors closed. Always check inside before running a cycle

## Toxic Plants: UK Common Offenders

## The First 48 Hours: A Survival Guide

### Before Puppy Arrives

1. **Do the crawl test** — Get on your hands and knees in every room your puppy will access. What can you see, reach, and chew from down there? That's their world
2. **Set up a safe space** — A crate or puppy pen in a main room gives them a secure den. Include a comfortable bed, a stuffed Kong or chew toy, a non-tip water bowl, and an old t-shirt that smells of you
3. **Decide on no-go zones** — Use baby gates to block rooms that aren't puppy-proofed
4. **Hide the good shoes** — Seriously. Do this now

### The First Night

- Expect crying. It's normal — they've just left their mum and siblings
- Keep the crate near your bed (you can gradually move it later)
- A warm hot water bottle wrapped in a towel mimics body warmth
- A ticking clock nearby can mimic a heartbeat
- DON'T let them cry it out for hours — brief comfort visits are fine

### The First Week

- **Supervise constantly** — If you can't watch them, they should be in their safe space
- **Redirect, don't punish** — Catch them chewing something they shouldn't? Swap it for an appropriate chew toy and praise
- **Establish a routine** — Feed, play, toilet, sleep. Repeat. Puppies thrive on predictability
- **Start toilet training immediately** — Take them outside after every meal, nap, and play session. Praise outdoor success; ignore indoor accidents

## When to Call the Vet: Emergency Signs

If your puppy shows any of these symptoms, contact your vet or the nearest emergency vet **immediately**:

- 🚨 **Seizures or tremors**

## The Bottom Line

Puppy-proofing isn't about creating a sterile, joyless home — it's about removing the genuinely dangerous stuff so your puppy can safely explore and learn. They *will* still chew things they shouldn't (RIP your favourite slipper). The goal is to make sure the things they reach won't hurt them.

Spend a Saturday afternoon going room by room with this checklist. It's a few hours of work that could save your puppy's life — and save you an eye-watering emergency vet bill.

Your puppy doesn't know what's dangerous. That's your job. Make their world safe, and they'll make your world wonderful.
