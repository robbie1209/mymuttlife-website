Labradors are Britain's favourite dog breed for good reason – they're loyal, friendly, and always up for an adventure.

## What Makes Labradors Different?

Before diving into specific foods, it's worth understanding why Labs have unique dietary needs:

### 1. They're Prone to Obesity
Labs have a genetic mutation (the POMC gene) that affects their satiety signals. Simply put, they rarely feel full. This makes portion control absolutely critical – your Lab will convince you they're starving even after a full meal.

### 2. Joint Health is Crucial
As a large breed, Labradors are susceptible to hip and elbow dysplasia. Foods containing glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega-3 fatty acids can support joint health throughout their lives.

### 3. That Iconic Coat Needs Support
The Lab's double coat requires good nutrition to stay healthy and manage shedding. Look for foods with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

### 4. They're High-Energy Dogs
Labs were bred as working retrievers. They need quality protein to maintain muscle mass and sustain their energy levels.

## Best Dog Food for Adult Labradors (1-5 Years)

### 1. Forthglade Complete – Best Value

**Why we love it:** Forthglade consistently ranks among the highest-rated affordable dog foods in the UK. Made in Devon with natural ingredients, their grain-free recipes offer around 75% meat content – impressive for the price point.

**Key features:**
- No artificial additives or preservatives
- Grain-free options available
- Single protein sources (great if your Lab has sensitivities)
- Added vegetables and botanicals

**Typical price:** £2-3 per day for a 30kg Lab

**Best for:** Budget-conscious owners who don't want to compromise on quality.

### 2. Royal Canin Labrador Retriever Adult – Best Breed-Specific

**Why we love it:** Royal Canin has done their homework on Labrador-specific nutrition. Their kibble is uniquely designed – the shape and size actually slows down eating, which is brilliant for Labs who inhale their food.

**Key features:**
- Specially shaped kibble to encourage chewing
- L-carnitine for healthy weight maintenance
- EPA and DHA for skin and coat health
- Adapted calorie content for weight management

**Typical price:** £3-4 per day for a 30kg Lab

**Best for:** Labs who eat too fast, or owners wanting targeted breed nutrition.

### 3. Wellness Core Large Breed – Best for Active Labs

**Why we love it:** If your Lab is a working dog, agility competitor, or just never stops moving, Wellness Core provides the protein punch they need. With deboned chicken and turkey as the first ingredients, it's seriously meaty.

**Key features:**
- 34% protein from quality animal sources
- Glucosamine and chondroitin for joints
- No wheat, corn, or soy
- Added probiotics for digestive health

**Typical price:** £3-4 per day for a 30kg Lab

**Best for:** Working Labs, highly active dogs, or dogs recovering from weight loss.

### 4. Butternut Box – Best Fresh Food

**Why we love it:** If you want to feed fresh, human-grade food without the hassle of home cooking, Butternut Box delivers pre-portioned meals straight to your door. Labs love it, and the difference in coat quality and energy is often noticeable within weeks.

**Key features:**
- Gently cooked, human-grade ingredients
- Personalised portions for your dog's needs
- Vet-formulated recipes
- No preservatives or artificial ingredients

**Typical price:** £4-6 per day for a 30kg Lab

**Best for:** Owners who want the best possible nutrition and don't mind the premium price.

## Best Dog Food for Senior Labradors (5+ Years)

As Labs age, their needs change. They need fewer calories (less activity), more joint support, and easily digestible proteins. Here's what we recommend:

### 1. Royal Canin Labrador Retriever 5+ – Best Overall Senior

**Why we love it:** Royal Canin's senior formula addresses the specific needs of ageing Labs. The reduced calorie content helps manage weight as activity decreases, while added nutrients support ageing joints and cognitive function.

**Key features:**
- Adapted fat and calorie content
- EPA, DHA, and glucosamine for joints
- Antioxidants to support brain health
- Same specially-shaped kibble as their adult formula

**Typical price:** £3-4 per day

### 2. Lily's Kitchen Senior Recipe – Best Natural Senior Option

**Why we love it:** For owners who prefer natural ingredients, Lily's Kitchen offers a gentle senior recipe with turkey, salmon, and vegetables. It's easily digestible and packed with joint-supporting ingredients.

**Key features:**
- Natural, human-grade ingredients
- Salmon oil for omega-3s
- Added glucosamine and chondroitin
- No artificial ingredients

**Typical price:** £3-4 per day

### 3. Consider Adding Joint Supplements

For senior Labs (especially those showing stiffness), adding a dedicated joint supplement alongside their food can make a real difference. Look for products containing:
- Glucosamine (500-1000mg daily for large dogs)
- Chondroitin
- MSM
- Green-lipped mussel

YuMOVE is a popular UK brand that many owners swear by.

## How Much Should You Feed a Labrador?

This is where many Lab owners go wrong. Despite what those pleading eyes tell you, most adult Labs need:

| Weight | Moderately Active | Highly Active |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| 25kg | 250-300g | 300-350g |
| 30kg | 300-350g | 350-400g |
| 35kg | 350-400g | 400-450g |

**Important notes:**
- These are guidelines – every dog is different
- Adjust based on body condition (you should be able to feel ribs but not see them)
- Senior Labs typically need 20-30% fewer calories
- Split daily portions into two meals to aid digestion

### The Body Condition Test

Run your hands along your Lab's ribcage:
- **Too thin:** Ribs clearly visible and easily felt
- **Ideal:** Ribs felt with slight pressure, visible waist when viewed from above
- **Overweight:** Ribs hard to feel under fat layer, no visible waist
- **Obese:** No waist, obvious fat deposits, ribs impossible to feel

Be honest with yourself – around 56% of UK Labs are overweight. Maintaining a healthy weight can add years to your dog's life.

## Wet vs Dry vs Raw: What's Best for Labs?

### Dry Food (Kibble)
**Pros:** Convenient, cost-effective, good for dental health, easy to measure portions
**Cons:** Can be less palatable, some dogs don't drink enough water

**Best for:** Most Lab owners, especially those concerned about portion control.

### Wet Food
**Pros:** Higher moisture content, often more palatable, great for fussy eaters
**Cons:** More expensive per meal, doesn't keep as well, less dental benefit

**Best for:** Senior Labs, dogs who don't drink much, or mixing with kibble.

### Raw/BARF Diet
**Pros:** Can be excellent for coat and digestion, mirrors natural diet
**Cons:** Requires research to balance properly, food safety considerations, more expensive

**Best for:** Experienced owners willing to do the work properly.

### Our Recommendation

For most Lab owners, a quality dry food supplemented with wet food a few times per week offers the best balance of nutrition, convenience, and cost. But ultimately, the "best" diet is one your dog thrives on – shiny coat, healthy weight, good energy, and firm stools.

## Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Labrador

Labs will eat almost anything, but some foods are dangerous:

❌ **Toxic foods:**
- Chocolate (especially dark)
- Grapes and raisins
- Onions and garlic
- Xylitol (artificial sweetener)
- Macadamia nuts
- Alcohol

⚠️ **Problematic foods:**
- Fatty foods (can cause pancreatitis)
- Cooked bones (can splinter)
- Large amounts of dairy
- Very salty foods

## Signs Your Lab's Food Isn't Working

Watch out for these indicators that you might need to switch foods:
- Dull, flaky coat
- Excessive scratching (without fleas)
- Persistent loose stools
- Low energy
- Excessive weight gain or loss
- Frequent ear infections
- Excessive gas

## Making the Switch

When changing your Lab's food, do it gradually over 7-10 days:

- **Days 1-2:** 75% old food, 25% new food
- **Days 3-4:** 50% old food, 50% new food
- **Days 5-6:** 25% old food, 75% new food
- **Days 7+:** 100% new food

This helps prevent digestive upset and gives your dog time to adjust.

## FAQ

### How often should I feed my adult Labrador?
Twice daily is ideal for adult Labs. This helps with digestion and reduces the risk of bloat.

### My Lab always seems hungry – is this normal?
Yes, unfortunately. Thanks to that POMC gene mutation, many Labs genuinely don't feel full. Stick to measured portions and resist those eyes.

### Should I feed grain-free food?
Not necessarily. Despite marketing claims, most dogs do fine with grains. Only go grain-free if your vet recommends it for specific health reasons. Some research has linked grain-free diets to heart problems in dogs.

### Is it OK to feed my Lab the same food every day?
Yes – dogs don't need variety like humans do, and switching foods frequently can cause digestive issues. Stick with what works.

## Final Thoughts

The best dog food for your Labrador is one that:
- Keeps them at a healthy weight
- Supports their joints
- Maintains a shiny coat
- They actually enjoy eating

Don't be swayed by marketing – focus on ingredient quality and your dog's individual response. And remember: the amount you feed is just as important as what you feed. Those Lab eyes are lying to you.

Your Lab will thank you with years of loyal companionship, muddy paw prints, and unconditional love. Feed them well.
