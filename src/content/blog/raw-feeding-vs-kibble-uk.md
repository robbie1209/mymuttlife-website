The raw feeding debate has become one of the most polarising topics in the UK dog world. Scroll through any dog owner Facebook group and you'll find passionate advocates on both sides — raw feeders who swear their dog has never been healthier, and kibble supporters who point to decades of veterinary science.

But what do actual UK veterinary professionals think? Not raw food companies. Not kibble manufacturers. Not Instagram influencers with affiliate links (though yes, we have some of those too — we'll be transparent about it).

We've dug into the latest veterinary guidance, charity positions, and peer-reviewed research to give you the most balanced picture possible. Because when it comes to feeding your dog, you deserve facts — not marketing.

## What Is Raw Feeding?

Raw feeding — sometimes called the BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) — involves feeding your dog uncooked ingredients. A typical raw diet includes:

- **Raw meat** (muscle meat, often on the bone)
- **Organ meat** (liver, kidney, heart)
- **Raw bones** (whole or ground)
- **Raw eggs**
- **Small amounts of fruit and vegetables**
- **Some dairy** (yoghurt, cottage cheese)

The philosophy behind raw feeding is that dogs evolved to eat raw meat, and that modern processed food is a relatively recent invention that doesn't match their biological needs.

Raw food is available in the UK in several formats:

- **DIY raw** — you buy and prepare ingredients yourself
- **Pre-made frozen** — complete meals delivered frozen (e.g., Bella & Duke, Nutriment, Natural Instinct)
- **Freeze-dried raw** — shelf-stable, rehydrate before serving
- **Cold-pressed** — technically cooked but at lower temperatures than kibble

## What Is Kibble?

Kibble is dry, commercially processed dog food. Ingredients are ground, mixed, cooked at high temperatures (extrusion), then dried and coated with fats and flavourings.

Modern premium kibble brands in the UK include:

- **Orijen and Acana** — high meat content, grain-free options
- **Millies Wolfheart** — UK-made, various protein sources
- **Eden** — 80/20 meat-to-plant ratio
- **Forthglade** — natural ingredients, UK-sourced
- **Burns** — hypoallergenic, vet-recommended

Budget options like Bakers, Pedigree, and Wagg use more fillers, artificial additives, and meat derivatives — and vets universally agree these aren't ideal.

## What UK Vets Actually Say

Here's where it gets interesting, because the veterinary world isn't unanimous.

### The Mainstream Position: Proceed With Caution

The majority of UK veterinary bodies advise **against** raw feeding, or at least urge significant caution:

**The PDSA** (People's Dispensary for Sick Animals) states clearly: *"Our vets don't recommend preparing your own pet food — whether cooked or raw — as without help from a specialist in pet nutrition a homemade diet could be nutritionally unbalanced."*

**The British Veterinary Association (BVA)** doesn't outright ban raw feeding but advises owners to *"consider the risks carefully"* and recommends commercially prepared complete diets as the safest option.

**The British Small Animal Veterinary Association (BSAVA)** has expressed concern about the lack of evidence supporting raw feeding and the documented risks of bacterial contamination.

### The Growing Pro-Raw Camp

However, there's a growing number of UK vets — particularly integrative and holistic practitioners — who actively support raw feeding:

- **Dr. Nick Thompson**, one of the UK's most prominent raw-feeding vets, has advocated for species-appropriate diets for over 20 years
- **Vets4Pets** and some independent practices now stock raw food and offer raw feeding consultations
- The **Raw Feeding Veterinary Society (RFVS)** — a growing group of UK vets specifically supporting raw diets

### The Honest Middle Ground

The most balanced veterinary position comes down to this: **a well-formulated commercial raw diet from a reputable manufacturer, handled hygienically, can be perfectly safe. A poorly formulated DIY raw diet can be genuinely dangerous. The same is true of kibble — a premium complete food is worlds apart from a budget filler-heavy option.**

In other words: **quality matters more than category**.

## The Evidence: Pros and Cons

### Documented Benefits of Raw Feeding

- **Improved coat condition** — consistently reported by owners and some veterinary studies
- **Smaller, firmer stools** — less filler means less waste
- **Better dental health** — raw meaty bones can help clean teeth (though this comes with its own risks)
- **Reduced allergy symptoms** — elimination of common kibble allergens (grains, additives)
- **Higher palatability** — fussy eaters often prefer raw
- **Improved energy and vitality** — widely reported anecdotally

### Documented Risks of Raw Feeding

- **Bacterial contamination** — Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter found in raw pet food samples (multiple UK studies)
- **Nutritional imbalance** — especially with DIY diets lacking calcium, essential fatty acids, or vitamins
- **Bone hazards** — choking, dental fractures, intestinal blockages or perforations
- **Risk to humans** — especially children, elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised people in the household
- **Higher cost** — typically 2-3x more expensive than equivalent quality kibble
- **Storage requirements** — needs freezer space, careful defrosting

### What the Studies Show

Here's the uncomfortable truth for both sides: **there are very few high-quality, peer-reviewed studies directly comparing raw and kibble diets in dogs over extended periods.**

Most evidence for raw feeding benefits comes from owner-reported surveys and anecdotal accounts. Most evidence against comes from food safety studies (which do consistently find bacterial contamination) and theoretical nutritional concerns.

Neither side has a slam-dunk scientific case.

## Cost Comparison: UK Prices in 2026

Here's a realistic monthly cost comparison for a medium-sized dog (20-25kg):

**Budget kibble** (Bakers, Wagg): £20-30/month — high in fillers, not recommended

**Mid-range kibble** (Burns, Forthglade): £40-55/month — good quality, complete nutrition

**Premium kibble** (Orijen, Eden): £60-80/month — high meat content, grain-free options

**Commercial raw** (pre-made frozen): £80-120/month — complete meals, convenient

**DIY raw**: £50-90/month — cheaper but requires nutrition knowledge

**Freeze-dried raw**: £100-150+/month — most expensive, most convenient

**Hidden costs to consider:** Raw feeding may reduce vet bills long-term (fewer skin issues, better dental health). Kibble feeding may require more dental treatments or allergy medications. Neither is guaranteed — every dog is different.

## Who Should Consider Raw Feeding?

Raw feeding might be worth exploring if:

- Your dog has persistent skin issues or food allergies unresponsive to kibble changes
- You've tried multiple kibble brands without improvement in digestive issues
- You have the time, budget, and freezer space for proper raw feeding
- No one in your household is immunocompromised, very young, or pregnant
- You're committed to strict hygiene practices
- You plan to use a commercially prepared complete raw food (not DIY without nutritional guidance)

## Who Should Stick With Kibble?

Kibble is likely the better choice if:

- You have young children who might handle dog bowls or be licked after mealtimes
- Anyone in the household has a compromised immune system
- Budget is a primary concern
- You travel frequently with your dog (kibble is far more portable)
- You prefer convenience and minimal food prep
- Your dog is thriving on their current diet with no health concerns

## How to Switch Safely (If You Decide To)

1. **Talk to your vet first** — especially if your dog has any existing health conditions
2. **Start with a commercially prepared complete raw food** — don't DIY without expert guidance
3. **Transition gradually** — mix raw with existing food over 7-14 days
4. **Choose a PFMA member manufacturer** — higher hygiene and nutritional standards
5. **Practice strict hygiene** — separate bowls, clean surfaces, wash hands thoroughly
6. **Monitor your dog closely** — watch for digestive changes, weight loss, or lethargy
7. **Get regular check-ups** — blood work after 3-6 months can confirm nutritional adequacy

## Our Honest Take

We're not going to tell you raw is magic or that kibble is poison. The truth is:

- **The best diet is one that's nutritionally complete, suits your dog's individual needs, and fits your lifestyle**
- A premium kibble is infinitely better than a poorly formulated raw diet
- A well-balanced commercial raw diet can offer genuine benefits for some dogs
- The worst option is cheap, filler-heavy kibble regardless of what else you do

Talk to your vet. Watch your dog. And ignore anyone — on either side — who makes you feel guilty for your choice.

Your dog doesn't care about the debate. They care about being fed, loved, and walked. Everything else is detail.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is raw dog food safe in the UK?

Commercially prepared raw food from PFMA members must meet hygiene standards. However, bacterial contamination risk exists. Practice strict hygiene and consult your vet.

### Do UK vets recommend raw feeding?

Most mainstream UK veterinary bodies urge caution. However, a growing number of vets support commercial raw feeding. The consensus: quality and completeness matter more than raw vs cooked.

### Is raw feeding more expensive than kibble?

Yes, typically 2-3x more for equivalent quality. However, some owners report lower vet bills over time. Budget approximately £80-120/month for a medium dog on commercial raw.

### Can I mix raw and kibble?

This is debated. Some vets say it's fine; others suggest the different digestion rates could cause issues. If you mix, do so at separate meals rather than in the same bowl.

### Is raw feeding safe around babies and children?

Extra caution is needed. The PDSA specifically advises against raw feeding in households with immunocompromised individuals, including very young children. If you do raw feed with children present, maintain extremely strict hygiene.
