Your dog's gut does a lot more than digest dinner. Around 70% of their immune system lives in their digestive tract, which means gut health affects everything from energy levels to skin condition, weight management, and even mood.

If your dog suffers from loose stools, excessive wind, a sensitive stomach after food changes, or has recently been on antibiotics, a good probiotic can make a real difference. But with dozens of products on the UK market — powders, chews, pastes, and capsules — it's hard to know which actually work.

We've researched the most popular options, checked the science behind the strains, and compared real UK pricing to help you choose the right one for your dog.

## Quick Comparison: Our Top 6 Picks

**YuMOVE Digestive Care** — Chewable tablets, ~£15–£20 (120 tabs). Best all-round daily digestive support.

**Purina Pro Plan FortiFlora** — Powder sachets, ~£20–£25 (30 sachets). Most vet-recommended, best post-antibiotics.

**Pooch & Mutt Bionic Biotic** — Sprinkle-on powder, ~£12–£15 (200g). Best for fussy eaters.

**Protexin Pro-Kolin+** — Paste syringe, ~£12–£18. Best for acute diarrhoea and fast relief.

**Dorwest Tree Barks Powder** — Natural powder, ~£10–£14 (100g). Best holistic/natural option.

**Pets Purest Advanced Probiotics** — Multi-strain powder, ~£15–£18 (150g). Best budget-friendly for multi-pet homes.

## What Are Dog Probiotics (And Do They Actually Work)?

Probiotics are live microorganisms — beneficial bacteria — that support a healthy balance of gut flora. Think of your dog's digestive system as an ecosystem. When it's balanced, digestion runs smoothly, nutrients get absorbed properly, and the immune system stays strong.

That balance gets disrupted by:

- **Antibiotics** (they kill good bacteria alongside bad)
- **Diet changes** (switching food brands or types)
- **Stress** (kennelling, fireworks, travel, new environments)
- **Illness** (infections, surgery recovery)
- **Ageing** (older dogs produce fewer beneficial bacteria naturally)

When the balance tips, you'll notice symptoms: runny stools, excessive gas, gurgling stomach, poor coat condition, or general lethargy.

**Do they actually work?** Yes — with caveats. Research consistently shows that specific probiotic strains improve digestive function in dogs. A 2020 study in *Frontiers in Veterinary Science* found that pregnant dogs given probiotics produced colostrum with significantly higher antibody levels, benefiting their puppies' immune systems. Multiple studies support *Enterococcus faecium* (the most common strain in dog probiotics) for managing diarrhoea and supporting gut health.

The key word is "specific strains." Not all probiotics are equal, and cheap supplements with unidentified strains or low colony counts may do nothing at all.

## Our Top 6 Dog Probiotics Available in the UK

### 1. YuMOVE Digestive Care — Best All-Rounder

**Type:** Chewable tablets · **Key ingredients:** Enterococcus faecium (NCIMB 10415), prebiotics (FOS & MOS), montmorillonite clay · **Price:** ~£15–£20 for 120 tablets

YuMOVE is one of the most trusted pet supplement brands in the UK, and their Digestive Care range reflects that reputation. The tablets combine a proven probiotic strain with prebiotics (which feed the good bacteria) and montmorillonite clay (which helps firm up loose stools).

**What we like:** Easy to dose — just pop a tablet in with food. Contains both pre and probiotics for a synergistic effect. UK company with strong vet endorsements. Most dogs take them willingly thanks to the chicken flavour.

**What to consider:** CFU count isn't disclosed on packaging (common with UK pet brands). Premium price compared to some alternatives. Tablets may be large for very small breeds.

**Best for:** Dogs who need everyday digestive support, especially those prone to occasional loose stools or mild food sensitivities.

### 2. Purina Pro Plan FortiFlora — Best Vet-Recommended

**Type:** Powder sachets · **Key strain:** Enterococcus faecium SF68 (1×10⁸ CFU per sachet) · **Price:** ~£20–£25 for 30 sachets

FortiFlora is the probiotic you'll most often see recommended by UK vets. It's backed by extensive clinical research and uses a single, well-studied strain at a documented potency. Each sachet is individually sealed, which helps maintain bacterial viability (probiotics are sensitive to heat and moisture).

**What we like:** Most-studied dog probiotic strain (SF68). Clear CFU count — you know what you're getting. Individual sachets maintain potency. Very palatable — most dogs love the taste. Widely available at vet surgeries.

**What to consider:** Single-strain only (no prebiotic included). Higher cost per day than some alternatives. Sachets create more packaging waste.

**Best for:** Post-antibiotic recovery, vet-recommended use, dogs with chronic digestive issues where a clinically proven product is important.

### 3. Pooch & Mutt Bionic Biotic — Best for Fussy Eaters

**Type:** Sprinkle-on powder · **Key ingredients:** Enterococcus faecium, chicory root (prebiotic), psyllium husk · **Price:** ~£12–£15 for 200g (approx. 2 months supply)

If your dog turns their nose up at tablets, Bionic Biotic is a brilliant alternative. The flavourless powder mixes invisibly into wet or dry food. It combines probiotics with prebiotic fibre from chicory root and psyllium husk for comprehensive gut support.

**What we like:** Truly tasteless — even fussy dogs won't notice it. Good value for money (2 months from one tub). Contains prebiotic fibre for complete gut support. B-Corp certified company, UK-made.

**What to consider:** CFU count not specified. Powder can clump if exposed to moisture. Less precise dosing than individual sachets.

**Best for:** Fussy eaters, dogs who reject tablets, owners wanting a simple sprinkle-on solution.

### 4. Protexin Pro-Kolin+ — Best for Acute Diarrhoea

**Type:** Palatable paste (syringe dispenser) · **Key ingredients:** Enterococcus faecium, preplex prebiotics, kaolin, pectin · **Price:** ~£12–£18 (30ml or 60ml syringe)

Pro-Kolin+ isn't just a probiotic — it's a complete digestive first-aid kit in a tube. The kaolin and pectin help bind loose stools and soothe the gut lining, while the probiotic and prebiotic work to restore bacterial balance. It's the product many vets reach for during acute stomach upsets.

**What we like:** Fast-acting for acute episodes. Easy-dose syringe — accurate and mess-free. Combines soothing agents with probiotics. Most dogs accept the taste readily. Available in different sizes for small and large breeds.

**What to consider:** Not designed for long-term daily use. More expensive per-dose than daily supplements. Paste format means it needs refrigeration after opening.

**Best for:** Acute diarrhoea, post-surgery recovery, stomach upsets from dietary indiscretion (bin raiding, eating something dodgy on a walk).

### 5. Dorwest Tree Barks Powder — Best Natural/Holistic Option

**Type:** Fine powder · **Key ingredients:** Slippery elm bark, white poplar bark (natural prebiotics) · **Price:** ~£10–£14 for 100g

Strictly speaking, Dorwest Tree Barks is a prebiotic rather than a probiotic — it feeds and supports existing beneficial bacteria rather than adding new strains. But it deserves a place here because it's one of the most effective natural gut-support products available in the UK.

Slippery elm bark has been used for centuries to soothe digestive issues. It creates a protective mucilage coating along the gut wall, reducing irritation and supporting natural healing.

**What we like:** 100% natural — no synthetic ingredients. Incredibly gentle on sensitive stomachs. Can be used alongside other probiotics. Long shelf life. Established UK herbal pet brand (since 1948).

**What to consider:** Prebiotic only — no live bacterial strains included. Needs mixing with water to form a paste before serving. Slightly more preparation than tablet/powder alternatives.

**Best for:** Dogs with chronic sensitivities, owners who prefer holistic/natural approaches, or as a complement to a standard probiotic.

### 6. Pets Purest Advanced Probiotics — Best Budget-Friendly Option

**Type:** Powder · **Key strains:** Multi-strain blend (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species) · **CFU count:** 2 billion · **Price:** ~£15–£18 for 150g

If you have multiple pets, Pets Purest offers solid value. Their advanced formula works for both dogs and cats, uses a multi-strain blend for broader coverage, and clearly states its CFU count — something many competitors avoid.

**What we like:** Clear CFU labelling (2 billion per serving). Works for dogs AND cats. Multi-strain formula for broader gut support. Good value per dose. UK company.

**What to consider:** Less brand recognition than YuMOVE or Purina. Multi-pet formulas may not be optimised specifically for dogs. Less clinical research behind the specific blend.

**Best for:** Multi-pet households, budget-conscious owners who still want a quality product with transparent labelling.

## How to Choose the Right Probiotic for Your Dog

### Match the Product to the Problem

- **General maintenance / prevention:** YuMOVE Digestive Care or Pooch & Mutt Bionic Biotic
- **After antibiotics:** Purina FortiFlora (most clinical evidence)
- **Acute diarrhoea / upset stomach:** Protexin Pro-Kolin+ (fast-acting paste)
- **Chronic sensitivity / IBD:** FortiFlora or YuMOVE (daily, long-term use)
- **Natural/holistic preference:** Dorwest Tree Barks + any probiotic
- **Multiple pets on a budget:** Pets Purest Advanced Probiotics

### Key Things to Look For

**Strain specificity:** Named strains (like *Enterococcus faecium SF68*) are better than vague "probiotic blend" labels. Named strains have documented research behind them.

**CFU count:** Colony Forming Units tell you how many live bacteria are in each dose. Higher isn't always better, but transparency is a good sign. Look for at least 100 million (1×10⁸) CFU.

**Prebiotic inclusion:** Products that combine probiotics with prebiotics (like FOS, MOS, or chicory root) tend to be more effective because the prebiotic feeds the probiotic bacteria, helping them colonise the gut.

**Storage and packaging:** Probiotics are living organisms. Heat, moisture, and oxygen kill them. Individually sealed sachets maintain potency best. Powders in tubs should be kept sealed and dry.

**UK manufacture:** Products made in the UK must comply with DEFRA regulations for animal feed supplements, providing a baseline quality assurance.

## When Should You Give Your Dog Probiotics?

**Definitely consider probiotics if your dog:**

- Has just finished a course of antibiotics
- Is experiencing loose stools or diarrhoea
- Is transitioning to a new food
- Is stressed (kennelling, moving house, new baby)
- Is a senior dog (7+ years)
- Has been diagnosed with IBD or food sensitivities

**You might also consider them for:**

- Puppies (to support developing gut flora)
- Dogs with skin issues (gut health affects skin condition)
- Dogs with excessive flatulence (the whole household will thank you)
- Pregnant or nursing dogs (research shows immune benefits for puppies)

### How Long Before You See Results?

Most owners notice improvements within **1–2 weeks** of consistent daily use. For acute issues (using something like Pro-Kolin+), you may see improvement within 24–48 hours. For chronic conditions, give it a full month before deciding whether it's working.

## Natural Probiotic Sources for Dogs

Not everything needs to come from a supplement. Some whole foods contain natural probiotics:

- **Plain, unsweetened yoghurt** — contains Lactobacillus strains. A tablespoon daily for medium dogs. Avoid anything with xylitol (toxic to dogs) or added sugar.
- **Kefir** — fermented milk drink with a broader range of probiotic strains than yoghurt. Start with a teaspoon and build up.
- **Raw goat's milk** — available from specialist pet shops. Easier to digest than cow's milk.
- **Fermented vegetables** — a tiny amount of plain sauerkraut (no onion, no garlic) can provide beneficial bacteria.

**Important:** Introduce natural sources gradually. Too much dairy too quickly can cause the exact digestive upset you're trying to prevent.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I give my dog human probiotics?

Not recommended. Human probiotics use strains optimised for the human gut, which differs significantly from a dog's digestive system. Some human supplements also contain ingredients (like xylitol sweetener) that are toxic to dogs. Stick to veterinary-formulated products.

### How long should my dog take probiotics?

For acute issues (post-antibiotics, stomach upset): 2–4 weeks is usually sufficient. For chronic conditions or general maintenance: many vets recommend ongoing daily use, especially for senior dogs or those with sensitive stomachs.

### Can probiotics cause side effects in dogs?

Mild side effects (temporary gas or slightly loose stools) can occur in the first few days as the gut adjusts. This usually resolves within 3–5 days. If symptoms worsen or persist, stop the supplement and consult your vet.

### Should I give probiotics with food or on an empty stomach?

Most dog probiotics are designed to be given with food. The food helps buffer stomach acid, giving more bacteria a chance to reach the intestines alive.

### Are probiotics safe for puppies?

Yes, most dog probiotics are safe for puppies from weaning age (around 6–8 weeks). FortiFlora is commonly recommended by vets for puppies. Check the individual product's age guidelines and start with a lower dose.

### Do probiotics help with dog allergies?

Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and allergic responses. While probiotics aren't a direct treatment for allergies, improving gut flora can support immune regulation, which may reduce allergy symptoms over time.

## The Bottom Line

A quality probiotic can genuinely improve your dog's digestive health, immune function, and overall wellbeing. The UK market has plenty of good options — the key is matching the product to your dog's specific needs.

**Our top recommendation for most dogs:** YuMOVE Digestive Care offers the best balance of quality, ease of use, and value as a daily maintenance supplement.

**If your vet has recommended a probiotic:** Purina FortiFlora has the strongest clinical evidence base and is the product most UK vets trust.

**For acute stomach upsets:** Keep a tube of Protexin Pro-Kolin+ in your pet first-aid kit. It's fast-acting and effective when your dog eats something they shouldn't have.

Whatever you choose, give it at least 2 weeks of consistent daily use before judging results. Gut health doesn't transform overnight — but with the right support, most dogs show noticeable improvements in digestion, stool quality, and energy within a month.
