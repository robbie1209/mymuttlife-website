Your dog spends up to 14 hours a day sleeping. That's more than half their life. So why are so many of us still letting them crash on a flat cushion that went pancake-thin six months ago?

A good dog bed isn't a luxury — it's basic health kit. The right one supports joints, keeps your dog warm (or cool), and gives them a proper den to retreat to. The wrong one? Aching hips, restless nights, and a dog who'd rather sleep on your sofa.

We've tested, researched, and compared the best dog beds available in the UK right now. Whether you've got a sprawling Great Dane or a curled-up Chihuahua, here's what's actually worth your money.

## What to Look for in a Dog Bed

Before we get into picks, here's what actually matters:

### Support
Orthopaedic memory foam is the gold standard for older dogs or larger breeds prone to joint issues. But younger, healthy dogs don't necessarily need it — a quality fibre-fill or bolster bed works perfectly well.

### Size
Your dog should be able to stretch out fully without hanging off the edge. Measure them nose to tail while lying down, then add 15-20cm. Most people buy too small.

### Washability
This is the one most people overlook. Dogs are filthy. If the cover isn't removable and machine-washable, you'll regret it within a month. Bonus points for waterproof liners.

### Bed Style
- **Bolster/sofa beds** — sides to rest their head on, great for dogs who like to lean
- **Nest/donut beds** — cosy and enclosed, perfect for curlers
- **Flat mattress beds** — maximum stretch room, ideal for sprawlers
- **Elevated/raised beds** — improved airflow, brilliant for dogs who overheat
- **Cave/hooded beds** — for anxious dogs or breeds that love to burrow

## Our Top Picks

### 🏆 Best Overall: Omlet Topology Dog Bed
**From £109 | omlet.co.uk**

Omlet's Topology is genuinely clever. It's a modular system: a solid orthopaedic memory foam base with interchangeable toppers (quilted, sheepskin, microfibre, even a cooling mat). When the topper gets grubby, unzip it and chuck it in the wash. The base stays fresh for years.

The customisation extends to the feet — you can choose from hairpin legs, brass caps, or wooden rails to match your décor. It sounds gimmicky, but it means the bed actually looks like furniture rather than a sad dog cushion in the corner of your living room.

**Best for:** Dogs of all sizes. Owners who want longevity and easy cleaning.
**Sizes:** Small, Medium, Large
**Washable:** Yes — removable toppers, machine washable

---

### Best Orthopaedic: George Barclay Country Dog Mattress
**From £149 | georgebarclay.co.uk**

If your dog has joint problems, hip dysplasia, or arthritis — or they're a larger breed entering their senior years — this is where your money should go. George Barclay make everything in the UK using high-density orthopaedic foam that genuinely holds its shape.

The covers are tough tweed or waterproof options, all removable. These beds look premium because they are — but they're also built to last 5+ years, which makes the price-per-year surprisingly reasonable.

**Best for:** Senior dogs, large breeds, dogs with joint issues
**Sizes:** Small to Extra Large
**Washable:** Removable covers, machine washable

---

### Best for Anxious Dogs: Baker & Bray Eco Luxe Nest Bed
**From £89 | bakerandbray.com**

Baker & Bray are a small UK brand doing things right. Their Eco Luxe range uses recycled materials (the filling is made from recycled plastic bottles) without compromising on quality. The raised bolster sides create a nest shape that anxious dogs love — it gives them something to press against, which is genuinely calming.

The memory foam base provides joint support, and the whole thing is machine washable. It's not the cheapest, but you're getting eco-credentials, orthopaedic support, and a bed that actually looks nice in your home.

**Best for:** Anxious dogs, dogs who like to curl up, eco-conscious owners
**Sizes:** Small, Medium, Large
**Washable:** Yes, fully machine washable

---

### Best Budget Pick: Silentnight Ultrabounce Pet Bed
**From £25 | Available at Argos, Amazon**

Yes, *that* Silentnight. The mattress people. They've brought their sleep expertise to dog beds, and the result is surprisingly solid for the price. The Ultrabounce filling is supportive without being rock-hard, and the non-slip base actually works on hard floors.

It won't last as long as a premium bed, and the filling will flatten over time. But for puppies (who'll chew through anything expensive), second beds for the car, or if you're genuinely on a tight budget, it's excellent value.

**Best for:** Budget buyers, puppies, spare beds
**Sizes:** Small, Medium, Large
**Washable:** Machine washable

---

### Best Elevated Bed: Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed
**From £30 | Amazon UK**

Elevated beds look odd if you've never seen one, but they're brilliant for specific situations. The mesh fabric allows air to circulate underneath, keeping your dog cool in summer. They're also great for dogs with thick coats (Huskies, Bernese Mountain Dogs) who overheat on traditional beds.

The steel frame is tough, the HDPE fabric is resistant to fleas and mould, and the whole thing can be hosed down. Not the cosiest option for winter, but pair it with a blanket and it works year-round.

**Best for:** Dogs who overheat, outdoor use, easy cleaning
**Sizes:** Small, Medium, Large
**Washable:** Wipe/hose clean

---

### Best Luxury: Ralph & Co Nest Bed
**From £150 | ralphand.co**

If aesthetics matter to you (and there's no shame in that), Ralph & Co make the most beautiful dog beds in the UK. Italian-designed with reversible cushions, removable covers, and a build quality that justifies the price.

The stonewashed cotton covers come in muted, earthy tones that actually complement modern interiors. The inner cushion is deep and supportive. These are the beds you see on Instagram and think "I wish my dog's bed looked like that."

**Best for:** Design-conscious owners, dogs who deserve the best
**Sizes:** Small to Extra Large
**Washable:** Removable covers, machine washable at 30°C

---

### Best for Small Dogs: Pup & Kit Snuggle Bed
**From £65 | pupandkit.com**

Small dogs have different needs. They lose body heat faster, they like to burrow, and they don't need (or want) a massive bed. Pup & Kit specialise in smaller breeds, and their snuggle beds are sized properly — not just "small" versions of big-dog beds that are still too large.

Soft, plush fabrics with raised sides create a warm pocket. Available in patterns that are actually tasteful. If you've got a Dachshund, Cavalier, or French Bulldog, this is the one.

**Best for:** Small breeds, dogs who burrow, cold dogs
**Sizes:** Designed specifically for small to medium-small breeds
**Washable:** Machine washable

## How Often Should You Replace a Dog Bed?

Most dog beds last 1-3 years depending on quality and how destructive your dog is. Signs it's time for a new one:

- **The filling has gone flat** — if you can feel the floor through it, it's done
- **It smells even after washing** — bacteria builds up in old foam
- **Your dog has stopped using it** — they know when it's uncomfortable
- **Visible damage** — exposed foam is a choking hazard

Premium beds (Omlet, George Barclay) can last 5+ years because you can replace individual components rather than binning the whole thing.

## Where to Buy Dog Beds in the UK

- **Direct from brands** — often the best prices and full range
- **Amazon UK** — widest selection, easy returns
- **Argos** — good for budget options, click & collect
- **Pets at Home** — can try before you buy in-store
- **John Lewis** — curated premium selection

**Money-saving tip:** Most brands run sales in January and Black Friday. If your dog's bed isn't urgent, it's worth waiting.

## FAQ

### Is memory foam worth it for dogs?
For senior dogs or breeds prone to joint issues (Labradors, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers), absolutely. The pressure relief is measurable and can genuinely improve mobility. For young, healthy dogs, it's nice-to-have rather than essential.

### Should I get a bed with sides?
Most dogs prefer bolster or nest-style beds because the sides give them something to lean against. But sprawlers — dogs who sleep flat on their backs with legs everywhere — do better with flat mattresses.

### How big should a dog bed be?
Measure your dog from nose to base of tail while lying down. Add 15-20cm. That's your minimum bed length. For width, measure shoulder to shoulder and add 15cm. When in doubt, go bigger.

### Can I wash a memory foam dog bed?
The foam itself usually can't go in the machine (it'll fall apart). But good memory foam beds have removable, machine-washable covers. The foam can be spot-cleaned and aired out. This is why beds with removable toppers (like the Omlet Topology) are so practical.

### My dog chews everything. What bed should I get?
For destructive chewers, avoid plush beds entirely. Go for an elevated bed (Coolaroo) or a heavy-duty canvas bed. Some brands like Kong make "chew-resistant" beds, though no bed is truly chew-proof. Address the chewing behaviour first — it's usually boredom or anxiety.
